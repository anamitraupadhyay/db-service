# Installation

DB Service is built using the Phoenix framework which is based on Elixir programming language. Before setting up this project, there are certain tools required to be installed on your machine.

## Pre-requisites

Install the following packages using your favorite package manager. Links are provided for some

- [Install Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#distributions)
  - Once installed, verify the installations using:

    ```sh
    elixir --version
    mix --version
    ```

- [Install Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  - For Postgres, this app defaults to `postgres` as both the username and password. This can be edited in `config/dev.exs` file.
  - Create a new database for the application called `dbservice_dev`.
  - Log into the database created.
  - Open the Postgres CLI and check the enabled extensions:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
    ```

  - If the `uuid-ossp` module isn't showing up, then run the following command. We require this extension in order to support the Postgres' `uuid_generate_v4` function that auto-generate UUIDs.

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
    ```

## Installation steps

Follow the steps below to set up the repo for development

1. Clone the repository and change the working directory

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/avantifellows/db-service-backend.git
    cd db-service-backend/
    ```

2. Start the Phoenix server:
   1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
   2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
   3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
3. Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Seeding fake data (optional)

If you want to seed your local database with random fake data, you can run this command:

```sh
mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
```

If you want to modify how this random fake data is getting seeded, you can modify this file `priv/repo/seeds.exs`.
